Choosing website options for the next big thing in life coaching

![](squatch1.jpg)

Prompt used:

Create a stylish webpage for a 'Sasquatch Lifecoach' business called 'OnlySquatch'. The premise is someone dressed as sasquatch has calls with you to help work through business and life decisions. The call to action is to subscribe to coach squatch on onlyfans. Use this phoeo (https://github.com/johnowhitaker/onlysquatch/blob/main/squatch1.jpg) somewhere, it's a 16:9 screenshot of a zoom call with him. Make the site stylish but a little bigfoot-themed :) Use only vanilla HTML/JS/CSS and put it all in a single .html file.
